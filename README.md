# React Readable Project

A small react-redux based blog. 
It's based on ReactNative components, don't you like it?


## TL;DR
To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* clone and run backend server https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter
* set backend url on process.env.SERVERURL or in /server/dbApi.js file
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
